# ANALISIS-DATA-GRUP-Masih_Pemula

Part A: Seed and Fertilizer Sales Analysis
In this analysis, we are tasked with examining a dataset containing 1,000 sales records from a regional agricultural supplies company. The dataset includes various attributes such as Sales ID, Customer ID, SalesRep ID, Product ID, Sales Quantity, Sales Amount, and Date of transaction. The primary goals are to:

Descriptive Analysis:

Calculate the total annual sales for each product during a specified period.
Determine the average sales per customer based on their characteristics.
Identify the top 3 sales representatives based on their total sales performance.
Data Visualization: Using tools like Power BI, we create several visualizations:

Total sales per product segmented by customer type.
Proportional sales distribution per customer type for each month over the year to identify seasonal trends.
Sales performance of the top 3 sales representatives over three years, highlighting any significant changes or events that impacted their performance.
Analysis and Reporting:

Provide a brief (200-300 words) analysis interpreting the results from the descriptive analysis and visualizations. Discuss insights, trends, anomalies, or strategic recommendations for future sales strategies in the seed and fertilizer market. Additionally, consider the impact of sales representative certifications on their performance.
Part B: Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prediction
In this part, we focus on leveraging data analysis to reduce the increasing instances of credit card fraud in a company that leads in the credit card and loan industry. The analysis involves:

Predicting Credit Card Billing Amount:

Build a predictive model using available variables to estimate the credit card bill amounts. The goal is to assess the accuracy and reliability of the model, identifying which variables are most or least relevant in predicting the billing amounts.
Clustering Model (3 Clusters):

Create a clustering model using features such as transaction amount, purchase location (latitude and longitude), city population, and merchant location. The goal is to classify customers into three distinct clusters and provide insights into customer demographics and behaviors. Based on these clusters, recommendations are made to increase the customer base of the company.
Fraud Detection Classification Model:

Develop a classification model (using techniques like KNN or Na√Øve Bayes) to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained and tested with a stratified dataset to handle imbalanced data, and the performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
The model will assist frontline workers by predicting fraud likelihood, enabling them to make quicker and more informed decisions when processing transactions.
